Axisymmetry is imposed in order to reduce the computational cost. The formulation is based on an earlier axisymmetric evolution scheme, adapted to time slices of constant mean curvature. Ideas from a previous study by Moncrief and the author are applied in order to regularize the formally singular evolution equations at future null infinity. Long-term stable and convergent evolutions of Schwarzschild spacetime are obtained, including a gravitational perturbation. The Bondi news function is evaluated at future null infinity.},

Going beyond the perfect fluid approximation, we compute the effective shear and bulk viscosities of the black brane. The values we obtain saturate generic bounds. Sound waves in the effective fluid are unstable, and have been previously related to the Gregory-Laflamme instability of black p-branes. By including the damping effect of the viscosity in the unstable sound waves, we obtain a remarkably good and simple approximation to the dispersion relation of the Gregory-Laflamme modes, whose accuracy increases with the number of transverse dimensions. We propose an exact limiting form as the number of dimensions tends to infinity.},

  abstract      = {Many and very general arguments indicate that the event horizon behaves as a stretched membrane. We explore this analogy by associating the Gregory-Laflamme instability of black strings with a classical membrane instability known as Rayleigh-Plateau instability. We show that the key features of the black string instability can be reproduced using this viewpoint. In particular, we get good agreement for the threshold mode in all dimensions and exact agreement for large spacetime dimensionality. The instability timescale is also well described within this model, as well as the dimensionality dependence. We conjecture that general non-axisymmetric perturbations are stable. We further argue that the instability of ultra-spinning black holes follows from this model.},
