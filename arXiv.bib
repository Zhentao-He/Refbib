  abstract      = {Electromagnetism plays an important role in a variety of applications in gravity that we wish to investigate. To that end, in this work, we present an implementation of the Maxwell equations within the adaptive-mesh pseudospectral numerical relativity code bamps. We present a thorough analysis of the evolution equations as a first order symmetric hyperbolic system of PDEs, including the construction of the characteristic variables for use in our penalty boundary communication scheme, and radiation controlling, constraint preserving outer boundary conditions which, in the language of Kreiss-Agranovich-M\'etivier, are shown to be boundary-stable. After presenting a formulation of the Maxwell constraints that we may solve for initial data, we move on to present a suite of numerical tests. Our simulations, both within the Cowling approximation, and in full non-linear evolution, demonstrate rapid convergence of error with resolution, as well as consistency with known quasinormal decay rates on the Kerr background. Finally we present evolutions of the electrovacuum equations of motion with strong data, a good representation of typical critical collapse runs.},

  abstract      = {We study the quasinormal modes of Boulware-Deser-Wheeler black hole in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity theory within the hyperboloidal framework. The effective potentials for the test Klein-Gordon field and gravitational perturbations of scalar, vector, and tensor types are thoroughly investigated and put into several typical classes. The effective potentials for the gravitational perturbations have more diverse behaviors than those in general relativity, such as double peaks, the existence of the negative region adjacent to or far away from the event horizon, etc. These lead to the existence of unstable modes ($\text{Im} \omega<0$), and the presence of gravitational wave echoes. These rich phenomenons are inherent in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory, rather than artificially introduced by hand. What's more, the (in)stability of quasinormal modes are studied in frequency-domain and time-domain, respectively. For the frequency-domain, the pseudospectrum is used to account for the instability of the spectrum. For the time-domain, we add a small bump to the effective potential, and find that the new waveform does not differ significantly from the original one, where the comparison is characterized by the so-called mismatch functions. This means that quasinormal modes are stable in time-domain regardless of the shapes of the original effective potentials. In this way, our study reveals the non-equivalence of the stability of quasinormal modes in the frequency-domain and the time-domain. Besides, we also numerically investigate Price's law at both finite distances and infinity with the assistance of the hyperboloidal approach.},

  abstract      = {We review the topic of 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, which has been the subject of considerable interest over the past two years. Our review begins with a general introduction to Lovelock's theorem, and the subject of Gauss-Bonnet terms in the action for gravity. These areas are of fundamental importance for understanding modified theories of gravity, and inform our subsequent discussion of recent attempts to include the effects of a Gauss-Bonnet term in four space-time dimensions by re-scaling the appropriate coupling parameter. We discuss the mathematical complexities involved in implementing this idea, and review recent attempts at constructing well-defined, self-consistent theories that enact it. We then move on to consider the gravitational physics that results from these theories, in the context of black holes, cosmology, and weak-field gravity. We show that 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity exhibits a number of interesting phenomena in each of these areas.},
