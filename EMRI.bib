  abstract      = {Second-order self-force calculations will be critical for modelling extreme-mass-ratio inspirals, and they are now known to have high accuracy even for binaries with mass ratios $\sim 1:10$. Many of the challenges facing these calculations are related to slow convergence of spherical-harmonic (or spheroidal harmonic) mode sums in a region containing the small companion. In this paper, we begin to develop a multi-domain framework that can evade those problems. Building on recent work by Osburn and Nishimura, in the problematic region of spacetime we use a puncture scheme and decompose the punctured field equations into a basis of Fourier and azimuthal $m$ modes, avoiding a harmonic decomposition in the $\theta$ direction. Outside the problematic region, we allow for a complete spherical- or spheroidal-harmonic decomposition. As a demonstration, we implement this framework in the simple context of a scalar charge in circular orbit around a Schwarzschild black hole. Our implementation utilizes several recent advances: a spectral method in each region, hyperboloidal compactification, and an extremely high-order puncture.},

As a demonstration, we compute the singular field to 14th order in distance, 10 orders beyond the previous state of the art, in the simple case of a scalar charge in circular orbit around a Schwarzschild black hole. We provide the result in both a 4-dimensional form and a decomposed form suitable for use in an m-mode puncture scheme.

  abstract      = {A binary extreme-mass-ratio inspiral (b-EMRI) is a hierarchical triple system consisting of a stellar-mass binary black hole (BBH) orbiting a central Kerr supermassive black hole (SMBH). Although predicted by several astrophysical models, b-EMRIs pose a challenge in waveform modeling due to their complex three-body dynamics and strong relativistic effects. Here we take advantage of the hierarchical nature of b-EMRI systems to transform the internal motion of the small binary into global trajectories around the SMBH. This allows us to use black hole perturbation theory to calculate both the low-frequency gravitational waveform due to its EMRI nature and the high-frequency waveform generated by the inner motion of the BBH. When the inner binary's separation vanishes, our calculation recovers the standard relativistic adiabatic EMRI waveform. Furthermore, by including the high-frequency perturbation, we find a correction to the waveform as large as the adiabatic order when the frequency matches the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of the SMBH, therefore supporting an earlier proof-of-concept study claiming that the small BBH can resonantly excite the QNMs of the SMBH. More importantly, we find that b-EMRIs can evolve faster than regular EMRIs due to this resonant dissipation through the high-frequency modes. These characteristics distinguish b-EMRI waveform templates from regular EMRI templates for future space-based gravitational-wave detectors.},

  abstract      = {We compute adiabatic waveforms for extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) by "stitching" together a long inspiral waveform from a sequence of waveform snapshots, each of which corresponds to a particular geodesic orbit. We show that the complicated total waveform can be regarded as a sum of "voices." Each voice evolves in a simple way on long timescales, a property which can be exploited to efficiently produce waveform models that faithfully encode the properties of EMRI systems. We look at examples for a range of different orbital geometries: spherical orbits, equatorial eccentric orbits, and one example of generic (inclined and eccentric) orbits. To our knowledge, this is the first calculation of a generic EMRI waveform that uses strong-field radiation reaction. We examine waveforms in both the time and frequency domains. Although EMRIs evolve slowly enough that the stationary phase approximation (SPA) to the Fourier transform is valid, the SPA calculation must be done to higher order for some voices, since their instantaneous frequency can change from chirping forward ($\dot f > 0$) to chirping backward ($\dot f < 0$). The approach we develop can eventually be extended to more complete EMRI waveform models, for example to include effects neglected by the adiabatic approximation such as the conservative self force and spin-curvature coupling.},

  abstract      = {Much of the success of gravitational-wave astronomy rests on perturbation theory. Historically, perturbative analysis of gravitational-wave sources has largely focused on post-Newtonian theory. However, strong-field perturbation theory is essential in many cases such as the quasinormal ringdown following the merger of a binary system, tidally perturbed compact objects, and extreme-mass-ratio inspirals. In this review, motivated primarily by small-mass-ratio binaries but not limited to them, we provide an overview of essential methods in (i) black hole perturbation theory, (ii) orbital mechanics in Kerr spacetime, and (iii) gravitational self-force theory. Our treatment of black hole perturbation theory covers most common methods, including the Teukolsky and Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli equations, methods of metric reconstruction, and Lorenz-gauge formulations, presenting them in a new consistent and self-contained form. Our treatment of orbital mechanics covers quasi-Keplerian and action-angle descriptions of bound geodesics and accelerated orbits, osculating geodesics, near-identity averaging transformations, multiscale expansions, and orbital resonances. Our summary of self-force theory's foundations is brief, covering the main ideas and results of matched asymptotic expansions, local expansion methods, puncture schemes, and point particle descriptions. We conclude by combining the above methods in a multiscale expansion of the perturbative Einstein equations, leading to adiabatic and post-adiabatic evolution schemes. Our presentation is intended primarily as a reference for practitioners but includes a variety of new results. In particular, we present the first complete post-adiabatic waveform-generation framework for generic (nonresonant) orbits in Kerr.},

  abstract      = {In electromagnetism, linearized general relativity, and other contexts, previous work has shown that the laws of motion which govern compact, self-interacting bodies can be obtained by applying "Detweiler-Whiting prescriptions" to the laws of motion which govern test bodies. These prescriptions replace any field which appears in a test-body law of motion with a certain effective field which is a quasilocal functional of the physical variables -- a functional that can be interpreted as a regularization procedure in a point-particle limit. We generalize these results, presenting a formalism which allows Detweiler-Whiting prescriptions to be be directly derived for extended bodies, even in nonlinear field theories. If a generating functional with particular properties can be constructed, we find effective linear and angular momenta which evolve via Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon equations involving appropriate effective fields. These equations implicitly incorporate all self-force, self-torque, and extended-body effects. Although our main focus is on bodies coupled to nonlinear scalar fields, we also remark on the gravitational case.},

  year          = {2025},
  month         = apr,
  abstract      = {Extreme Mass Ratio Inspiral (EMRI), which corresponding to a small compact object inspirals around a Massive Black Hole (MBH) in the center of a galaxy, is one of the most important kind of source for future space-borne gravitational-wave (GW) detectors such as TianQin and LISA. By analyzing the emitted GW signals, we can probe the theory of gravity and the nature of black holes (BHs) in the strong field region. To achieve these objectives, the second order self-force effect should be considered in the waveform modelling. Up to now, the waveform of EMRIs including the second order self-force effect is only achieved for the circular orbit on Schwarzschild background. In this work, we generalized the calculation of the second order self-force to the eccentric orbits on Schwarzschild spacetime. We calculated the puncture field, and give the form of two timescale expansion for the field equations. The corresponding numerical calculation and programming can be performed based on these results.},

The analytical solutions are expressed in terms of the elliptic integrals using Mino time $\lambda$ as the independent variable. Mino time decouples the radial and polar motion of a particle and hence leads to forms more useful to estimate three fundamental frequencies, radial, polar and azimuthal motion, for the bound timelike geodesics in Kerr spacetime. This paper gives the first derivation of the analytical expressions of the fundamental frequencies. This paper also gives the first derivation of the analytical expressions of all coordinates for the bound timelike geodesics using Mino time. These analytical expressions should be useful not only to investigate physical properties of Kerr geodesics but more importantly to applications related to the estimation of gravitational waves from the extreme mass ratio inspirals.},
