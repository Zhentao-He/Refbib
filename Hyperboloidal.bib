  abstract      = {Time functions with asymptotically hyperbolic geometry play an increasingly important role in many areas of relativity, from computing black-hole perturbations to analyzing wave equations. Despite their significance, many of their properties remain underexplored. In this expository article, I discuss hyperbolic time functions by considering the hyperbola as the relativistic analog of a circle in two-dimensional Minkowski space and argue that suitably defined hyperboloidal coordinates are as natural in Lorentzian manifolds as spherical coordinates are in Riemannian manifolds. The presence of the null cone adds new elements to this analogy, particularly regarding the smooth foliation of the asymptotic boundary.},

  abstract      = {We study the quasinormal modes of Boulware-Deser-Wheeler black hole in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity theory within the hyperboloidal framework. The effective potentials for the test Klein-Gordon field and gravitational perturbations of scalar, vector, and tensor types are thoroughly investigated and put into several typical classes. The effective potentials for the gravitational perturbations have more diverse behaviors than those in general relativity, such as double peaks, the existence of the negative region adjacent to or far away from the event horizon, etc. These lead to the existence of unstable modes ($\text{Im} \omega<0$), and the presence of gravitational wave echoes. These rich phenomenons are inherent in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory, rather than artificially introduced by hand. What's more, the (in)stability of quasinormal modes are studied in frequency-domain and time-domain, respectively. For the frequency-domain, the pseudospectrum is used to account for the instability of the spectrum. For the time-domain, we add a small bump to the effective potential, and find that the new waveform does not differ significantly from the original one, where the comparison is characterized by the so-called mismatch functions. This means that quasinormal modes are stable in time-domain regardless of the shapes of the original effective potentials. In this way, our study reveals the non-equivalence of the stability of quasinormal modes in the frequency-domain and the time-domain. Besides, we also numerically investigate Price's law at both finite distances and infinity with the assistance of the hyperboloidal approach.},

  abstract      = {This work offers a didactical introduction to the calculations and geometrical properties of a static, spherically symmetric spacetime foliated by hyperboloidal time surfaces. We discuss the various degrees of freedom involved, namely the height function, responsible for introducing the hyperboloidal time coordinate, and a radial compactification function. A central outcome is the expression of the Trautman-Bondi mass in terms of the hyperboloidal metric functions. Moreover, we apply this formalism to a class of wave equations commonly used in black-hole perturbation theory. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive derivation of the hyperboloidal minimal gauge, introducing two alternative approaches within this conceptual framework: the in-out and out-in strategies. Specifically, we demonstrate that the height function in the in-out strategy follows from the well-known tortoise coordinate by changing the sign of the terms that become singular at future null infinity. Similarly, for the out-in strategy, a sign change also occurs in the tortoise coordinate's regular terms. We apply the methodology to the following spacetimes: Singularity-approaching slices in Schwarzschild, higher-dimensional black holes, black hole with matter halo, and Reissner- Nordstr\"om-de Sitter. From this heuristic study, we conjecture that the out-in strategy is best adapted for black hole geometries that account for environmental or effective quantum effects.},
